a normal hash house harriers run consists of laying trails in the ground (using markers such as grain, flour, or red lentils) for runners to detect and follow.


it had happened on a fairly routine play -- the sprightly welker had caught a short pass on the left side and was running with it near the left hash mark when he went to cut around a defender.

 "i enjoy all football jobs, i haveto say,  and certainly i've enjoyed it here but referee ed hochuli overturned it on  replay, saying that since the defender landed out of bounds with his hand on the  ball, it was considered out of bounds" on atlanta's next possession, jones ran  across the field, catching a 10-yard pass near the left hash mark, then outran  the indy defense for an 80-yard score to make it 21-0 less than three minutes  into the second quarter"unfortunately for chinese taipei, center fielder kuo hui  lo, a seattle mariners minor leaguer, suffered a dislocated right ankle and leg  fracture on a slide while being thrown out at home by reddick to end the inning  they also have held opponents to 343 yards or fewer in four of their past five  ballgames, and are finally forcing turnovers (two last game) and sacking the  quarterback (15 in their last four games)

 honda's ima (integrated motor assist) hybrids, such as the civic hybrid and the insight , sit near the hash mark that's one quarter of the way along the line thanks to a somewhat larger motor and battery, plus a measurable range of electric-only driving.


the southwest quadrant near the hash house is rich in points - not surprising since there are also 6-hour and 12-hour events.

 to the left of church, both linebackers near the hash ( sean lee and bradie james ) will be playing "man" as well; lee on anthony fasano and james on reggie bush.


visibly thrilled by the introduction of the hash house committee members as the "mis-managers" and the amusing hash names allotted to some like "osama bin  laden", the hash name of our grand master and "lord kris" the hash name of our  joint master, the president was eager to bestow hash names for her colleagues in  the near future.
thereafter, the hash whip or religious advisor took over proceedings and charged  all the "offenders", some of whom were required to sit on ice while some  hilarious hash hymns were sung to mark their "conviction" and "sentencing".

 there is nobody on the picture or it's not even near the hash).

 the site, at the military  holiday camp on the pranburi road, was quite near hash run number one that had  been hared by tom and may eight years earlier.

  however, eric smith who was at the 2-yard line near the right hash (approximately 6 yards in front of torrey) leapt and got a piece of the ball to avert the td.


linear hashing begins searching at the collision point by stepping through the table, incrementing by the constant value c.

� linear hashing results in significant primary and secondary clustering problems, and is the least effective hashing method.


quadratic hashing resolves some of the behavior issues present in a linear hash.

0x linear hashing becomes the fastest.


linear hashing saw the largest gains from table size, due to the extremely long probe lengths from high primary and secondary clustering.

� once the probe lengths become short, the speed of the hash function becomes the dominant measure, and linear hash becomes more efficient than double or quadratic hashing.

� it shows that the probe lengths for a linear hash are significantly higher than the lengths for other methods.

� this explains why linear hashing is the fastest at a small load factor.

� at high load factors, linear hashing showed the slowest timings while quadratic and double hashing resulted in similar, faster times.

5x, linear hashing showed the best performance due to the increased weighting on the speed hash function.

� due to this effect, linear hashing times were faster than perfect hashing at large sizes, although this difference is not asymptotically significant.

� (16146 probes �15338 searches)� since the probe length becomes 1, the linear hash does not need to compute its hash function to step to the next slot.

� due to the complexity of computing the perfect hash function, this would likely account for the speed advantage of linear hash, and eliminate it.

� regardless of this optimization, the asymptotic running time of perfect hash is equal or greater than that of linear hash.
variation of hash function
several graphs titled �perfect hash - varying hash functions� show the results of using different hash functions with the perfect hash.

� this should be considered a near perfect distribution, and the graph shows how closely existing standard hash methods come to approximating this.

� near infinite possibilities still exist for chaining, and minimal perfect hashing has yet to be fully explored.

  it wasn’t far from the play- it was in the direction of travel of the play, it was right outside the near hash (paul was coming up near the sideline).

  look here to see if there is a hash near you.
enjoy viewing our hash!

  particularly when you consider that near enough every hash algorithm used now is combined with a random salt, making it kinda pointless anyway.

 versus man-to-man coverage, the receiver will continue his route across the field, but versus zone, he will have to read the frontside (for purposes of this concept, the frontside is the side the dragging receiver is moving towards) linebacker and either continue across the field or cut off his route near the opposite hash-mark and turn towards the quarterback.

8 seconds left on the clock and the ball being taken out of bounds near the hash, doc rivers drew up a late game gem.

  some of those shots came from around the top of the left circle or high slot, but more often the shot came from just above the faceoff dot or near the left hashmark.

  once he crosses the blue line, the other two drive the net and he is often given a 1-on-1 situation with a defender to create some space for himself and get a shot off from near the faceoff dots or hash marks.

authentic neapolitan pizza that leaves most other amsterdam pizzerias in the dust
located on haarlemmerdijk, a lively street full of shops, cafes and restaurants, and coffeeshops, and not far from the westergasfabriek culture park ; other locations close to the vondelpark and artis zoo
despite its excellent quality, prices are comparable to most other pizzerias in town
