Paris is a very compact city so being close to the Eiffel Tower isn’t an advantage nor is being a bit further from the center such a big disadvantage but still, on the whole, I stay in the 4th,5th or 6th arrondissements when I’m in Paris and find that more convenient.

 You will enjoy the fact that it is located            very close to the Eiffel Tower, to the Porte de Versailles and its Exhibition            Fair, and to Unesco.

Le Marquis Eiffel is located in Paris's Eiffel Tower - Orsay Museum neighborhood, close to UNESCO Headquarters, Eiffel Tower, and Arc de Triomphe.

  We were close to the Eiffel Tower, shops and restaurants and a short walk to the metro.
